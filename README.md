currently reading, mythical man month, Edible economics, Mort? Goal is 4ish books a month, and 1 audio book. maybe add art book? 

^^^ Note to above, I do want to get back to roots and delve back into fairy tales, fables, and mythos. Though Pratchet and Gaiman are the Modern version...
Need to read sandman series, and finish journey to the west as well.

Maybe add a favorite image section or header, maybe change monthly or something?
