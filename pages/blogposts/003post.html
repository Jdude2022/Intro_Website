      <h2>Blog post 3 "Little late this time."</h2>
      <p>
        Allrighty then week three! It's the end of the week but still in the 
        week! Not really to much going on, I think my problem is spreading myself
        to thin so I am starting to work toward fixing that. Got back to doing 
        full stack open so that is good news. Might drop game dev to one day a 
        week and focus on Design patterns and getting algos down good.
      </p>
      <h3>Weekly plan list</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Need to buld back up to 2 hours a day for the react, but did hit at least
            30mins a day 
        </li>
        <li>Need to narrow my focus down I think I am getting hit with shiny
            object syndrome from art, design and programming. To much I want to
            do but not enough time. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Life updates</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Been volunterring at a fireworks stand this week not the biggest 
                fan it's different.
            </li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Personal Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Still like the animated/interactible vector art splash screen</li>
            <li>Life size sculpture by 38th birthday</li>
            <li>Just trying to build up work stamina</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Professional Goals</h3>
        <p>Ohh boy, the carrer change goals, how fun. I just want a office job man.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Need a little logo for the site, and tab thing, forgot what its called.</strong></li>
            <li>Vim too since it makes me feel <em>cool</em></li>
            <li> Running through Full stack open, trying to do 2 hours a day</li>
            <li> So keeping the focus on asthetics, still think this is super important</li>
            <li>60 second project trailers still a great idea in my mind, I just need to finish a project first...
                Still in love with the 80s asthetic and over use of corny effects, might do the 60 seconds videos in a "fun" format.
            </li>
            <li>Really liking the idea of html slides with Reveal.js/svelte slides.com if I am being laszy. Possibly a slides subdomain, to keep projects there. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>In Case AI takes over the world.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ok so check this out, ADULT TRIKE AND TRAILER, with a bubble machine on the back.</li>
            <li>So dope.</li>
        </ul>
