      <h2>4 On the Floor.</h2>
      <p>
        Week four baby! Pretty cool, it's thrusday had a pretty fun week, still
        wast not able to keep up with what I wanted to do. :(  Sad face.
        So I think I am going to remake my schedule and adjust prioritys a bit 
        this week.
      </p>
      <h3>Weekly plan</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>So we (royal type) are going to try 2 2 hour blocks up programming 
            related activivites, one at 8-10 and another between 3-5. depending
            on how the day is going. 
        </li>
        <li>Changed the art schedule up a bit, instead of a daily focus. I am
            goiing to try a weekly hour deal. Might work out better! 
        </li>
        <li>
            Brought game dev back, to a fridays only type deal.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Life updates</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Totally Nothing new.
            </li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Personal Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Life size sculpture by 38th birthday</li>
            <li>Just trying to build up work stamina</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Professional Goals</h3>
        <p>Ohh boy, the carrer change goals, how fun. I just want a office job man.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Need a little logo for the site, and tab thing, forgot what its called.</strong></li>
            <li>Vim too since it makes me feel <em>cool</em></li>
            <li> Running through Full stack open, trying to do 2 hours a day</li>
            <li> So keeping the focus on asthetics, still think this is super important</li>
            <li>60 second project trailers still a great idea in my mind, I just need to finish a project first...
                Still in love with the 80s asthetic and over use of corny effects, might do the 60 seconds videos in a "fun" format.
            </li>
            <li>Really liking the idea of html slides with Reveal.js/svelte slides.com if I am being laszy. Possibly a slides subdomain, to keep projects there. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>In Case AI takes over the world.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ok so check this out, ADULT TRIKE AND TRAILER, with a bubble machine on the back.</li>
            <li>So dope.</li>
            <li>Music and art. 3d printing toy type stuff would be legit,
                Dunno If I could compete against video games... 
            </li>
        </ul>
