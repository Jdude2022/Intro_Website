      <h2>Blog post 2 "So much to do, so little time!"</h2>
      <p>
        Well, week two since I decided to start doing this. There are just so many things I want to do, I feel like this <em>might</em> keep me on track.
        So the general plan for this week is to do react more, and keep up with it. But man, no one tells you how hard keeping up with this stuff is, the lack of physical exhaustion is really throwing 
        me for a loop... But its like the ~2nd year of actuelly  programming so I get it now, just have to find a way to trick my brain into keeping up and not slacking off.
        Also need to keep up with the projects I have going on. 
      </p>
      <h3>Weekly plan list</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Do the react projects, I keep slacking off and have to keep restarting.</li>
        <li>Look into porting this site over to hugo, Markdown would be so much easier to format, and hugo looks super helpful</li>
        <li>Game dev and art for a hour a day each would be nice.</li>
        <li>Find a better time for my runs, the heat is starting to get to me at around noon, 80 degree weather is killer.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Life updates</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Well on week two of blogging, hopefull I can build up streaks on more stuff.</li>
            <li>Have a doctor apointsment soon, should switch over to outmeal to help lower cholestral and weight.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Personal Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>So many sweets and snacks in the house, it's made losing weight a task, gonna switch over to oatmeal for lunch, and leave dinner as my main meal.</li>
            <li>Have the great life size scultpure goal by my 38th birthday.
            </li>
            <li>Play at least 2 videos games through by the end of summer, Super hard 
                to find time for them now. About 8 hours into the Outer worlds.
                I really like space envirements, I'm excited for the new starfield game.
            </li>
            <li>Would love to look more into after effects animations, and try my hand at 
                putting these soon to be reacurring blog posts in video format.
                Vector art too.
            </li>
            <li>So animated vector art page. svg animated page that morphs when a link is clicked. art deco style. Seems interesting to try. Keep the internet fun.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Professional Goals</h3>
        <p>Ohh boy, the carrer change goals, how fun. I just want a office job man.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Need a little logo for the site, and tab thing, forgot what its called.</strong></li>
            <li>Vim too since it makes me feel <em>cool</em></li>
            <li> Running through Full stack open, trying to do 2 hours a day</li>
            <li> So keeping the focus on asthetics, still think this is super important</li>
            <li>60 second project trailers still a great idea in my mind, I just need to finish a project first...
                Still in love with the 80s asthetic and over use of corny effects, might do the 60 seconds videos in a "fun" format.
            </li>
            <li>Really liking the idea of html slides with Reveal.js/svelte slides.com if I am being laszy. Possibly a slides subdomain, to keep projects there. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>In Case AI takes over the world.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Trying to pick up the accordion, but I have litterly played it only once this entire year, havent touched it in a week.</li>
            <li>Ended up getting a maschine mk3 too so gotta learn beat making with that.</li>
            <li>Juggling too, if the robot overloards take over, busking looks fun. I love people
                and making people smile isn't a bad goal to have.
            </li>
            <li>Still think human art has value, just need to find a way to connect with the audiance. Ala megeminds presenation speech.</li>
        </ul>
