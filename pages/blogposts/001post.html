      <h2>Blog post 1 "Hello World"!</h2>
      <p>
        Lots to do but so little time. Anyway I was reading some manga and I liked
        how a translator was doing little life update posts as his intro page. So that
        inspired me to try my hand at a weekly blog post, and hopefully inspire
        me to work on this website! Anyways format and styling <em>Should</em>
        evolve as I keep this up, but with my track record we will see.
      </p>
      <h3>Life updates</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Summer vaction so a lot of self focused stuff, I'm just trying to get used to sitting at a desk for more then 2 hours at a time</li>
            <li>Birthday is in a few months, I am interested to see what 30 looks like.</li>
            <li>Started this blog deal, so hopefully I can come back to it weekly.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Personal Goals</h3>
      <p>Not really in any perticual order, lately ive just been throwing stuff at the 
        proverbial wall and seeing what sticks... </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have the great life size scultpure goal by my 38th birthday. So I Should
                really start learning how to sculpt. Anatomy too but you know.
            </li>
            <li>Play at least 2 videos games through by the end of summer, Super hard 
                to find time for them now. About 3 hours into the Outer worlds.
                So far it's super cool.
            </li>
            <li>Would love to look more into after effects animations, and try my hand at 
                putting these soon to be reacurring blog posts in video format.
            </li>
            <li>Reading more too, but lol</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Professional Goals</h3>
        <p>Ohh boy, the carrer change goals, how fun. I just want a office job man.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Need a little logo for the site, and tab thing, forgot what its called.</strong></li>
            <li>Vim too since it makes me feel <em>cool</em></li>
            <li> Running through Full stack open, trying to do 2 hours a day</li>
            <li> Trying to learn art so an hour a day here too, It feels like 
                asthetics matter a whole lot with the amount of people running into the field.
                Plus since Im one of them gotta find a way to stand out.
            </li>
            <li>Video editing, and advertisment I wanna put a 60 second 'ad' and maybe
                5 min explination video for every project I do. You can have the greatest
                project in the world but if you can't market it, the project doesn't 
                exist... Also manufactured expierience, I think showing through fun little advertisments Should
                act like proof I atleast can do the work on my own and i'm not totattly faking the funk.
            </li>
            <li>To that end, maybe a bit of graphic design and poster development</li>
            <li>Minoring in econ so I need to keep up with that too, the world is crazy right now.</li>
            <li>Forgot trying to do 1-2 hours of game dev a day too.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>In Case AI takes over the world.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Trying to pick up the accordion, but I have litterly played it only once this entire year</li>
            <li>Ended up getting a maschine mk3 too so gotta learn beat making with that.</li>
            <li>Juggling too, if the robot overloards take over, busking looks fun. I love people
                and making people smile isn't a bad goal to have.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Anyway "So much to do and so little time", I feel like the rabbit of Alice in Wonderland.
            I do love fairytales so I wanna try and tie those in. Might give me an excuse to read more too!
            Anyway the first few of these should be streams of conciness until I come up with a format.
